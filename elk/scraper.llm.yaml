scraper:
  folder: scraper/
  lang: 
    python:
      venv: scraper/.venv
      requirements: requirements.txt
  objective:
    Use open-source information about park safety to compile a data set for Elk
  architecture:
    components:
      - page finder
      - downloader
      - parser
      - inserter
  commander runner:
    file: scraper/Justfile
    description: Useful commands are stored here
    required:
      - download:
          runs: downloader.py
          input: output/urls.txt
          ouput: output/html
      - parse:
          runs: parser.py
          input: output/html
          ouput: output/json
      - debug-prompt:
          same as: parse
          except: uses prompt debug mode

page finder:
  ## Disable building page finder for now
  ## It is a nice to have. A list of urls can just be provided for now.
  build: false 
  objective:
    Identity trusted webpages on the internet that have accurate park safety information
  output:
    - urls

downloader:
  objective:
    Download HTML webpages to a folder
  input:
    - page finder urls
  output:
    - html documents
  requirements:
    - re-runnable:
        If the url in input has already been downloaded, do not download it again
    - graceful error handling:
        One url failing to download should not stop all urls from failing to download
        Failed url should be logged. Because of re-runnable requirement, the original input
        can just be re-run by user.

parser:
  objective:
    Use on-device large language model to transform HTML documents to hazards, locations, and tips.
  input:
    - downloader html documents
  output:
    - json:
        one file per input document: each input document should output a serialized json
        model speficiation: all models are specified in models.llm.yaml
        structure:
          - tips: 
              type: array of Tips
          - hazards:
              type: array of Hazards
          - locations:
              type: array of locations
  large language model:
    access: 
      description: Assume ollama is running locally
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 11434
    model: gpt-oss:20b
    prompt:
      - Explain the elk system to the llm.
      - Explain the hazard, locations, and tip models to the llm.
      - Explain the objective for this query
      - Mark the beginning of the document
      - Insert document
      - Mark the end of the document
  requirements:
    - re-generate:
        Every time the script is run, if the JSON file is already generated, re-generate it.
    - include presentations:
        If a hazard is present in a mentioned location, a presentation array should be included in the
        hazards object with the location.
    - omit coordinates:
        Coordinates should be omitted if they are not mentioned in the document
    - strip documents:
        description: HTML documents should be stripped of all HTML tags and syntax. Only the textual elements of the document should be included. This will reduce tokenization time for the LLM.
        implementation:
          package: beautiful soup
          include: text on any element in the HTML document
          exclude: code
    - promompt debugging:
        Provide an option so that the entirety of the prompt for the first document will be logged

inserter:
  ## We will build this after we get the downloader and the parser are working
  build: false
  objective: 
    Insert json files into the api database
